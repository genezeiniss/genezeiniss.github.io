    <!-- Case Studies Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Featured Case Studies (Real-World Projects)</h2>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Case Study: Implementing a Hybrid SDK for Sensitive Data Detection</h3>
        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>At Intuit, as the lead engineer for a Java-based application that detects sensitive data, I was responsible for preventing data leakage and safeguarding customer information. The application included a RESTful service and a Hybrid SDK designed for latency-sensitive clients.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
        <p>Frequent Updates: The classifiers used for sensitive data detection evolved continuously, requiring a way to push updates without forcing SDK upgrades.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>To overcome these challenges, I designed and developed a Hybrid SDK architecture that decoupled dynamic components, such as data classifiers and validation logic, from the SDK itself. This allowed us to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offload dynamic configuration to an external repository.</li>
            <li>Load classifiers dynamically without requiring SDK updates.</li>
            <li>Monitor SDK usage and performance across different clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Results & Impact</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminated Forced SDK Upgrades: Clients could seamlessly receive classification updates without modifying their SDK version.</li>
            <li>Improved Performance: The Hybrid SDK optimized latency by combining local execution with dynamic remote configuration.</li>
            <li>Better Visibility & Control: The monitoring system provided insights into SDK usage, client versions, and performance trends.</li>
            <li>Scalability for Future Growth: The architecture supported Intuitâ€™s roadmap to expand classification coverage from 40 to over 200 data types.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Case Study: Transitioning from Monolith to Microservices with an Anti-Corruption Layer</h3>
        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>At Behalf, we embarked on a strategic initiative to transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices. This was a necessary step to improve scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Legacy System Dependencies â€“ The majority of internal processes still relied on the monolithic system, which made a full transition impractical in the short term.</li>
            <li>Semantic and Lifecycle Mismatch â€“ The legacy system and the new microservice had different semantics and entity lifecycles, making them completely incompatible.</li>
            <li>Incremental Rollout Complexity â€“ The new microservice had to be rolled out gradually without disrupting ongoing business operations.</li>
            <li>Data Consistency & Synchronization â€“ Ensuring data consistency between the monolith and the microservices was crucial to avoid discrepancies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
        <p>To address these challenges, I introduced an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) that acted as an intermediary between the legacy system and the new microservice. This layer was responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Translating requests and responses between the two systems.</li>
            <li>Ensuring data consistency across different entity lifecycles.</li>
            <li>Allowing the microservice to operate with its domain model, free from legacy constraints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Results & Impact</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ACL successfully enabled a smooth transition, allowing both systems to coexist without major disruptions.</li>
            <li>Business operations continued without interruptions, even as internal processes gradually shifted to microservices.</li>
            <li>The approach minimized rework and prevented legacy dependencies from corrupting the new systemâ€™s design.</li>
        </ul>
